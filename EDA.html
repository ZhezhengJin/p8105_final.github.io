<p>The table provides descriptive statistics for various variables in
the dataset. Key insights include the average <code>annual_pm2.5</code>
level being 7.0, with a small standard deviation of 1.1, indicating
relatively consistent air quality. Additionally, variables such as
<code>premature_percentage</code> and
<code>cancer_mortality_per_10k</code> show slight variability with a
small number of missing values, while hospitalization rates and
demographic characteristics exhibit diverse distributions. Overall, the
summary highlights the central tendency, variability, and distribution
characteristics of the dataset’s variables.</p>

<p>This stacked bar chart displays the racial demographics across 62 New
York counties. Each bar represents a county and is divided into segments
that reflect the percentage of the county’s population of the following
racial categories: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic
White, Hispanic Black, and Other. The majority of New York State
population is non-Hispanic-White, which is also the major racial group
in almost all counties, except in Bronx county and Queens county.</p>

<p>The prevalence of our 5 outcomes of interest across 62 counties are
illustrated in these 5 graphs below. For each outcome, we have
highlighted the TOP 5 to be circled with <span style="color:red;"> red

there are many data points for NY State.</p>
